Tiny basic flashlight app.  Tired of flashlights that take like 5-10 seconds to load, have too many bells and whistles, and covered in ads.  Wrote my own; took maybe 45 min.

This one is ~97Kb, starts up in a fraction of a second, and just has one button covering the screen.  Only downside IMO is it may crash the first time you run it - just accept the camera permission and it should work from then on.
